    takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function...
    println!("{}", s); // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5; // x comes into scope
    makes_copy(x); // x would move into the function, but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still use x afterward
    println!("{}", x); // x is still valid here
